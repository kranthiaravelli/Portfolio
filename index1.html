            <h2>Java</h2>
            <img src="java.png" alt="java-logo" class="logos1">
            <p>I am seeking to learn Java, as I believe it’s one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages for backend development, app creation, and large-scale systems. I haven’t started learning it yet, but I’m excited to begin soon and understand its core concepts like object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. I know that mastering Java will strengthen my programming foundation and open up more opportunities in my journey toward becoming a full stack developer.</p>

            <p>I am seeking to learn React.js, as it’s one of the most popular and in-demand JavaScript libraries for building modern, interactive, and efficient user interfaces. I haven’t started learning it yet, but I’m eager to explore how components, states, and props work together to create dynamic web applications. Learning React.js will help me take my front-end development skills to the next level and move closer to becoming a skilled full stack web developer.</p>

            <p>I am seeking to learn Python, as it is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language widely used in web development, data science, automation, and artificial intelligence. I haven’t started learning it yet, but I’m eager to explore its simplicity and powerful capabilities. Learning Python will not only improve my programming logic but also expand my opportunities in various tech fields, making me a more well-rounded and capable developer.</p>

            <img src="adobe.png" alt="adobe-logo" class="logos">
            <p>As a student interested in designing, I have a pure desire to learn and master Adobe tools. Just because I have a laptop that cannot handle the software, I stayed simple without trying the adobe tools. I although installed it somehow into my unsupported laptop, but that was useless. In future after getting a pretty good laptop, I would definitely learn the skill of editing using adobe tools.</p>
