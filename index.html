                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <img src="htmllogo.png" alt="html-logo" class="logos">
                <p>I have developed a strong command of HTML, with around 90% proficiency in using it to create well-structured, responsive, and visually appealing web pages. Over time, I’ve become confident in writing clean, organized code and understanding the core principles of web structure and design. From building simple layouts to developing more complex page structures, HTML has become one of my strongest technical skills, forming the foundation for all my front-end development projects.</p>

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <img src="csslogo.png" alt="css-logo" class="logos">
                <p>I have a moderate level of experience with CSS, around 50–60% proficiency. I understand how to style and format web pages, create layouts, and apply colors, fonts, and effects to make designs visually appealing. While I’m still improving my knowledge of advanced concepts like animations, transitions, and responsive design, I can confidently handle most styling tasks and continuously practice to strengthen my skills. I enjoy experimenting with CSS to bring creativity and personality to my projects.</p>

                <img src="jslogo.png" alt="js-logo" class="logos">
                <p>I’m currently learning JavaScript and exploring its concepts step by step. Though I’m at the beginner level right now, I’m eager to understand how it brings interactivity and functionality to websites. I’ve started practicing the basics like variables, loops, and functions, and I’m excited to progress toward more advanced topics soon. With consistent learning and hands-on practice, I’m confident that I’ll gain strong JavaScript skills and use them to create dynamic, engaging web experiences.</p>

                <img src="clogo.png" alt="c-logo" class="logos">
                <p>I’m currently learning the C programming language and have started to feel a bit confident in writing and compiling code on my own. Understanding how C works is helping me build a strong foundation in programming logic and problem-solving. I believe this knowledge will be very useful for backend development, as it helps me understand how systems and memory work behind the scenes. Learning C is definitely shaping my way of thinking like a real programmer.</p>
